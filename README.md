  Exchange notes, files, and other study materials seamlessly within the app.

- **User Feedback and Rating System:**  
  After each study session, rate your partner to improve future pairing, ensuring quality matches over time.

- **AI-Powered Pairing:**  
  Optionally, leverage an AI agent to enhance matching accuracy based on user preferences and study behaviors.

  Focused, one-on-one study sessions without any additional features.
